This is an R interface to the [SCIP Optimization
Suite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18580).\
[SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/) is one of the fastest non-commercial
solvers for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP). It is also a framework for constraint integer
programming and branch-cut-and-price. It allows for total control of the
solution process and the access of detailed information down to the guts
of the solver.

## Installation

Install the released version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("scip")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bnaras/scip")
```

## Usage

Refer to the vignettes for examples. However, one of the easiest way to
use this and many other solvers is via [`CVXR`](https://cvxr.rbind.io/)
(version 1.8.2 and higher).
